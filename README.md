# Tic-Tac-Toe in Clojure

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cmvandrevala/tic-tac-toe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cmvandrevala/tic-tac-toe)

# Project

This is an implementation of tic-tac-toe in Clojure. I wrote it to become familiar with functional programming concepts and to learn the syntax of [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/), [SpeclJ](http://speclj.com/), and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). As of now, it runs a simple human vs. human game on the console with little validation of the user input. In the future, I might expand the game to include more sophisticated validation, computer players, and a game menu.

# Test

You can run the test suite by using the command:

```
lein spec
```

# Run

You can start a game of tic-tac-toe on the console by using the command:

```
lein run
```
